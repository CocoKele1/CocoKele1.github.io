I am a Master research student in the VR Lab at <a href="https://www.bit.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)</a>, advised by Prof. Dongdong Weng, majoring in <strong>Virtual Reality and Human-Computer Interaction</strong>. Meanwhile, I am a visiting student at the Institute of Human-Computer Interaction and Media Integration at <strong>Tsinghua University</strong>, supervised by Prof. Yu Chun. My current interest is how AI-powered VR can better improve human-computer interaction, especially in human cognition and mental health. Prior to master, I obtained Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and technology at <strong>Zhengzhou University</strong> in 2021.

I have spent a colorful summer in 2023. I attended the HCIX Research Club and became an intern at the <strong>APEX Lab of HKUST</strong> led by Prof. Mingming Fan, independently supporting an HCI project.  After this, I studied <strong>3D generation algorithms</strong> advised by Prof. Ping Tan at the HKUST, including 3D Scene and 3D Talking Head.
