I am a Master research student in the VR Lab at Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), advised by Prof. Dongdong Weng, majoring in Virtual Reality and Human-Computer Interaction. Meanwhile, I am a visiting student at the Institute of Human-Computer Interaction and Media Integration at Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. Yu Chun. My current interest is how AI-powered VR can better improve human-computer interaction, especially in human cognition and mental health. Prior to master, I obtained Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and technology at Zhengzhou University in 2021.

I have spent a colorful summer in 2023. I attended the HCIX Research Club and became an intern at the APEX Lab of HKUST led by Prof. Mingming Fan, independently supporting an HCI project.  After this, I studied 3D generation algorithms advised by Prof. Ping Tan at the HKUST, including 3D Scene and 3D Talking Head.
