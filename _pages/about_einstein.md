I am a Master research student in the VR Lab at Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), advised by Prof. Dongdong Weng, majoring in Virtual Reality and Human-Computer Interaction. Meanwhile, I am a visiting student at the Institute of Human-Computer Interaction and Media Integration at Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. Yu Chun. My current interest is how AI-powered VR can better improve human-computer interaction, especially in human cognition and mental health. Prior to master, I obtained Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and technology at Zhengzhou University in 2021.
