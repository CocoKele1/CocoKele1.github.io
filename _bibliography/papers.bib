  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={A Stroop-based Long-term Cognitive Training Game for the Elderly in Head-mounted Displays},
  author={Qiuxin Du, Haiyan Jiang, Dongdong Weng, Sansan Chen},
  abstract={Virtual reality (VR) games have been increasingly incorporated into the cognitive training of the elderly because of their unique immersion and interactivity. However, previous studies have focused on existing commercial games, which are not suitable for the elderly. Due to the progressive decline in cognitive abilities and inflexible action of the elderly, we propose a VR music game (LightSword) based on two classical psychological paradigms (Dual-task and Stroop). To enable long-term cognitive training of the elderly in a playful and relaxed virtual environment, the game integrates easy interactions, motivating mechanisms with real-time feedback, and pleasant music. The results of the prior study show a linear increase in game performance scores which are related to cognitive ability, demonstrating the potential of the proposed game for cognitive training.},
